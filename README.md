## Welcome to my vehicle dashboard project

<!--You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Eas94/dash/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.-->


### Hardware

The project will be equipped with a [Waveshare 7.9" IPS touch display](https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/displays/7.9inch-dsi-lcd.htm) with the resolution 400x1280, for a sleek aspect ratio of 16:5. This will be driven by a Raspberry Pi, hopefully equipped with radar distance sensors and an OBD-II reader. Perhaps even a Nvidia Jetson and cameras for features such as lane keeping alert, road surface condition estimation, and more.


<!---
Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
